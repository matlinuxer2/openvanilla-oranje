OpenVanilla
===========

OpenVanilla is a cross-platform input method framework. This branch, called Oranje, focuses on providing a reference implementation based on OS X and a reference distribution.


Build and Installation
======================

1.  Build OpenVanilla.xcodeproj with Xcode
2.  Copy the built product, here we assume you're using the Release configuration, to the input method folder:

    *   For Mac OS X Leopard: Copy build/Release/OpenVanilla.app to ~/Library/Input Methods
    *   For Mac OS X Tiger: Copy build/Release/OpenVanilla.bundle to /Library/Components
    
Limitations
===========

1.  No Preferences app is provided. Edit the configuration in ~/Library/Preferences/org.openvanilla.plist. Changes take effect immediately.
2.  The candidate window is largely simplified. Only a minimal text label is provided.
3.  Only the core modules are provided and are currently bundled directly with the loader itself. (The project also builds OVIMPOJ, but does not bundle it into the distributed package.)
    *   OVIMArray
    *   OVIMEsperanto
    *   OVIMGeneric (when there is data)
    *   OVIMPhonetic
    *   OVIMTibetan
    *   OVIMUnicode    
4.  Output filters are not supported in this branch. Maybe not yet. Maybe for good.

On Mac OS X Tiger Support
=========================

This OpenVanilla implementation uses [IMK-Tiger](http://code.google.com/p/imk-tiger/) to provide Mac OS X Tiger support so that the IMK-based loader can be retrofitted into a text service manager bundle.

As Apple is releasing Mac OS X 10.6, it no longer makes sense to support Mac OS X Tiger. In this branch, Tiger-specific version (the product OpenVanilla.bundle) is still built, but there is no promise any future modification on the loader would maintain the build. No regression testing will be actively performed.
